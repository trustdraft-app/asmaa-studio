# Asmaa Studio Decision Log

**Question:** How should the bride reservation link and owner admin dashboard work on the current static GitHub Pages deployment?
**Decision:** Implement `/reserve` and `/admin` as Supabase-ready client pages, require Supabase Edge Function persistence for live writes, and keep a structured WhatsApp fallback when backend variables are missing.
**Reasoning:** A direct anonymous browser insert from a static website would violate the required origin/rate-limit/security boundary, while the WhatsApp fallback lets the new bride link work immediately.

**Question:** Which domain should be canonical for the live site?
**Decision:** Use `asmaa.video` as the GitHub Pages custom domain and redirect `asmaavideo.com` to `https://asmaa.video`.
**Reasoning:** One canonical domain avoids splitting SEO authority, and `asmaa.video` is shorter and aligned with the service category.
